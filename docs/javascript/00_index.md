JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Here are some key points about JavaScript:

1. **Client-Side Scripting**: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, where it runs in the user's web browser to create interactive web pages.

2. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.

3. **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is event-driven, allowing developers to create responsive and interactive web applications.

4. **Prototype-Based**: JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

5. **Versatile**: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development (with environments like Node.js).

6. **Standardized**: JavaScript is standardized by ECMAScript (ES), with ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introducing many modern features.

Example of a simple JavaScript code:
```javascript
// Display a greeting message
console.log("Hello, world!");

// Function to add two numbers
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

JavaScript is essential for modern web development, enabling dynamic content, interactive forms, animations, and much more.
