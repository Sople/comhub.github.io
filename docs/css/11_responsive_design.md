Responsive Design includes knowledge of:

1. **Fluid Grids**: Using relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels to create flexible layouts.
2. **Flexible Images and Media**: Ensuring images and media scale appropriately within their containing elements.
3. **Media Queries**: Applying CSS rules based on device characteristics such as screen width, height, and orientation to adapt the layout.
4. **Viewport Meta Tag**: Configuring the viewport for proper scaling and rendering on different devices.
5. **Mobile-First Design**: Designing for smaller screens first and progressively enhancing the design for larger screens.
6. **Breakpoints**: Defining specific points where the layout changes to accommodate different screen sizes.
7. **Responsive Typography**: Adjusting font sizes and line heights to ensure readability across devices.
8. **Testing and Debugging**: Using tools and techniques to test and debug responsive designs on various devices and screen sizes.
9. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring that responsive designs load quickly and efficiently on all devices.
10. **Accessibility**: Making sure that responsive designs are accessible to users with disabilities.
