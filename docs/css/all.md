CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of web content. It covers various types of knowledge, including:

1. Selectors and Basic Syntax
Selectors: Targeting elements in HTML to apply styles (e.g., div, .class, #id).
Syntax: Basic structure like selector { property: value; }.
2. Box Model
Content: The actual content inside the element.
Padding: Space between content and border.
Border: A line around the padding.
Margin: Space outside the border separating elements.
Understanding how these properties interact and affect layout.
3. Layout
Positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky.
Flexbox: A layout module for one-dimensional layouts.
Grid: A two-dimensional layout system that provides more complex arrangements.
Float and clear: For older layout techniques.
4. Typography
Font Properties: font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height.
Text Styling: text-align, text-decoration, letter-spacing, word-spacing.
5. Colors and Backgrounds
Color Models: HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA.
Background Properties: background-color, background-image, background-position, background-size, background-repeat.
6. Responsive Design
Media Queries: Adjusting layout/styles for different devices and screen sizes.
Viewport Meta Tag: Essential for mobile responsiveness.
Units: Use of flexible units like %, vw, vh, em, rem.
7. Transitions and Animations
Transitions: Smoothing changes of properties over time (transition, transition-duration).
Keyframe Animations: Defining animations with @keyframes and applying them with animation properties.
8. Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements
Pseudo-Classes: Styling elements in specific states (e.g., :hover, :focus, :nth-child).
Pseudo-Elements: Styling specific parts of an element (e.g., ::before, ::after).
9. Z-index and Stacking Context
Z-index: Controls the layering of elements along the z-axis (depth).
Understanding how stacking contexts form and affect element rendering.
10. CSS Variables (Custom Properties)
Declaring reusable values using --variable-name and accessing them via var(--variable-name).
11. CSS Frameworks and Preprocessors
Frameworks: Like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, which provide predefined styles and components.
Preprocessors: Like SASS, LESS, which introduce variables, nesting, and functions for more dynamic styling.
12. Browser Compatibility and Vendor Prefixes
Handling cross-browser compatibility issues.
Using vendor prefixes (-webkit-, -moz-, etc.) for experimental or non-standard properties.
13. CSS Specificity and Inheritance
Understanding the specificity rules for resolving which styles are applied.
Inheritance: Some properties inherit values from parent elements, while others do not.
Mastering these areas of CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and responsive web designs.
