The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and rendered on a web page. It includes the following components:

1. **Content**: The actual content of the box, where text and images appear.
   ```css
   .box {
       width: 100px;
       height: 100px;
   }
   ```

2. **Padding**: The space between the content and the border. It adds space inside the element.
   ```css
   .box {
       padding: 10px;
   }
   ```

3. **Border**: The area surrounding the padding (if any) and content. It can have different styles, widths, and colors.
   ```css
   .box {
       border: 2px solid black;
   }
   ```

4. **Margin**: The space outside the border. It creates space between the element and other elements.
   ```css
   .box {
       margin: 15px;
   }
   ```

### Example
Here is an example that combines all these components:
```css
.box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    margin: 15px;
}
```

### Visual Representation
- **Content**: The innermost part where the actual content is displayed.
- **Padding**: Surrounds the content, adding space inside the element.
- **Border**: Surrounds the padding and content, providing a visual boundary.
- **Margin**: Surrounds the border, creating space between the element and other elements.

Understanding the Box Model is crucial for designing and laying out web pages effectively.
